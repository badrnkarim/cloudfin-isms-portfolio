# ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS / GRC Portfolio (Audit-Grade) — CloudFin SaaS Scenario

This repository contains an **audit-grade ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) portfolio** built for a fictional B2B SaaS company (“CloudFin Analytics”).  
It is designed to demonstrate **GRC / ISMS / Internal Audit capability** through **end-to-end traceability** and **verifiable evidence** (**EV-001 → EV-015**).

---

## Why this portfolio is “audit-grade”
This repo is structured like a real assurance engagement and supports full traceability:

**Risk → Control (SoA) → Evidence → Internal Audit → CAPA → Follow-up Verification**

You can review artifacts, evidence, and audit outputs exactly as an auditor or hiring manager would.

---

## What this demonstrates (capabilities)
- **ISO 27001 ISMS implementation:** scope, policy, risk methodology, objectives, documented information control
- **Risk-based control selection:** risk register → SoA applicability/justification → implementation status
- **Internal audit execution:** audit program/plan, checklist, evidence log, findings report
- **Corrective action lifecycle:** CAPA procedure, tracker, closure evidence, and verification
- **Operational readiness documentation:** incident response plan & tabletop, backup/restore testing, supplier assessment, vulnerability workflow, access review, awareness training
- **Evidence discipline:** every implemented item maps to an evidence ID (EV-###)
