# CloudFin ISMS / Assurance Portfolio (ISO 27001-aligned)
**Owner:** Badr Karim  
**Focus:** Internal ISMS assurance (documentation, risk, controls, audit, CAPA) for a B2B SaaS scenario.

## What this is (60 seconds)
This repository is a realistic, evidence-backed **ISO/IEC 27001-aligned ISMS portfolio** for a fictional B2B SaaS company (“CloudFin Analytics”).  
It demonstrates how I build assurance artifacts end-to-end:
- Define ISMS scope, policy, and risk method
- Maintain risk register + Statement of Applicability (SoA)
- Build an internal audit program, checklist, evidence log, and audit report
- Track corrective actions (CAPA) to closure with linked evidence
- Establish practical controls evidence using GitHub governance (PR workflow, protected branches, Dependabot)

## Why it matters
This shows I can do **real GRC/assurance work**: traceability, evidence discipline, audit-ready records, and control lifecycle management.

## Repo map (start here)
- **01_ISMS_Core/** — core ISMS docs + procedures + review records  
- **02_Registers/** — risk register, SoA, vulnerability log  
- **03_Audit_Pack/** — audit program/plan/checklist/evidence log/report + CAPA tracker  
- **04_Evidence/** — screenshots and evidence index linking EV-### → requirement  
- **05_Exports_Final_PDF/** — (optional) final compiled exports

## Quick proof (high-value evidence)
- **Change management enforced (Annex A 8.32):** EV-002, EV-004  
- **Vulnerability identification enabled (Annex A 8.8):** EV-003  
- **Objectives defined (Clause 6.2):** EV-005  
- **CAPA process defined (Clause 10.1):** EV-006  
- **Management review record (Clause 9.3):** EV-007  
- **Vulnerability management procedure + log (Annex A 8.8):** EV-008  
- **Repo access review record (Annex A 8.4):** EV-009  

## How to review (fast)
1) Open **04_Evidence/EV-INDEX...** to see every evidence item and its mapped requirement.  
2) Open **03_Audit_Pack/AUD-005...** for the audit findings.  
3) Open **03_Audit_Pack/AUD-006...** for corrective actions tracked to evidence.
