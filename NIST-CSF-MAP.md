# ISO 27001 → NIST CSF Mapping (High-Level)

This mapping is a high-level alignment of this portfolio’s ISO 27001 artifacts/evidence to NIST CSF functions.

## GOVERN
- Internal audit program/report (AUD-001..AUD-005) → Governance oversight
- Management review (ISMS-007, MR-001, EV-007) → Leadership governance
- CAPA procedure + tracker (AUD-007, AUD-006, EV-006) → Continuous improvement

## IDENTIFY
- Scope & context (ISMS-001) → Organizational understanding of in-scope assets/processes
- Risk method + risk register (ISMS-003, ISMS-004) → Risk identification and evaluation
- SoA (ISMS-005) → Control applicability decisions

## PROTECT
- Change management controls (EV-002, EV-004; SoA A.8.32) → Controlled change implementation
- Access governance (AR-002, EV-009; SoA A.8.4) → Least privilege / access review

## DETECT
- Vulnerability discovery signal (EV-003) → Detection of dependency issues

## RESPOND
- CAPA workflow (AUD-007, EV-006) → Response through corrective actions

## RECOVER
- (Planned) Backup/restore test record → Recovery assurance (future evidence)
