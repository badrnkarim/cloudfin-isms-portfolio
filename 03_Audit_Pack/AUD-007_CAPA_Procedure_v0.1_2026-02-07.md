## 1. Purpose
Define how CloudFin Analytics records, investigates, corrects, and verifies nonconformities to ensure effective corrective actions and continual improvement of the ISMS.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to nonconformities and improvement actions identified through:
- Internal audits (AUD-005 findings)
- Security incidents and events
- Risk reviews and control failures
- Customer complaints related to security
- Management review outputs

## 3. Definitions
- **Nonconformity (NC):** Failure to meet a requirement (ISO/ISMS/contractual).
- **Corrective action:** Action to eliminate the cause of a nonconformity and prevent recurrence.
- **Containment (immediate correction):** Short-term action to reduce impact while investigating root cause.
- **Effectiveness review:** Check that corrective action prevented recurrence and improved control.

## 4. CAPA Workflow (Required Steps)
1) **Record** the item in the CAPA Tracker (AUD-006) with a unique CAPA ID and related source (audit finding, incident, etc.)  
2) **Containment / immediate correction** to reduce impact if needed  
3) **Root cause analysis** (5-Whys or fishbone) documented in AUD-006  
4) **Corrective action plan** defined (actions, owners, due dates)  
5) **Implementation** of corrective actions with evidence (EV-### / records)  
6) **Verification** that actions were completed (review evidence and outcomes)  
7) **Effectiveness review** (confirm risk reduced / issue does not recur)  
8) **Closure**: update AUD-006 status to Closed and link evidence

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities
- **CAPA Owner:** Responsible for implementing actions and providing evidence.
- **Security/GRC (Badr):** Maintains CAPA tracker, verifies evidence, validates effectiveness, and closes CAPA.
- **Management (simulated):** Reviews significant issues and approves risk acceptance where applicable.

## 6. Records
- AUD-006 CAPA Tracker (primary record)
- Evidence files (EV-###) and supporting documents referenced in AUD-006
- Updated Audit Report (if re-issued) or follow-up audit notes
