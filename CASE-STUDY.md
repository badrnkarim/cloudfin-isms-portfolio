# Case Study — Building and Auditing an ISO 27001-Aligned ISMS (CloudFin Analytics)

## Context
CloudFin Analytics is a B2B SaaS scenario. Goal: build an ISO 27001-aligned ISMS baseline and demonstrate internal assurance with traceable evidence.

## What I delivered
- ISMS scope, policy, and risk methodology (ISMS-001/002/003)
- Risk Register + Statement of Applicability (ISMS-004/005)
- Internal audit program, plan, checklist, evidence log, and audit report (AUD-001..AUD-005)
- CAPA procedure + CAPA tracker (AUD-007, AUD-006)
- Management review template + first review record (ISMS-007, MR-001)
- Vulnerability management procedure + vulnerability log with SLA targets (VULN-001, VULN-LOG-001)
- Access review template + completed access review record (AR-001, AR-002)

## Assurance evidence (high value)
- Change management evidence: EV-002, EV-004
- Vulnerability signal + governance: EV-003, EV-008
- Objectives and metrics: EV-005
- Corrective action process: EV-006
- Management review record: EV-007
- Access review record: EV-009

## Internal audit outcomes
Audit findings were tracked into CAPA and verified. CAPA items closed:
- CAPA-001 (Clause 6.2): Closed — EV-005
- CAPA-002 (Clause 10.1): Closed — EV-006
- CAPA-003 (Clause 9.3): Closed — EV-007
- CAPA-004 (Annex A 8.8): Closed — EV-008
- CAPA-005 (Annex A 8.4): Closed — EV-009
