## 1. Purpose
Define how CloudFin Analytics identifies, evaluates, prioritizes, remediates, and verifies technical vulnerabilities affecting the CloudFin SaaS service and supporting components.

## 2. Scope
Applies to vulnerabilities discovered in:
- Application dependencies (e.g., GitHub Dependabot alerts)
- OS/container/base images (as applicable)
- Cloud configuration and infrastructure components (as applicable)
- Internal code issues identified by review/testing

## 3. Sources of Vulnerability Information
- GitHub Dependabot alerts and security updates (EV-003)
- Vendor advisories and public vulnerability disclosures (CVE)
- Internal findings (audit findings, testing findings, incidents)

## 4. Severity and Remediation Targets (SLA)
CloudFin uses severity-based SLAs:

| Severity | Definition (general) | Remediation Target |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Remote exploit or high impact with high likelihood | 7 days |
| High | Significant impact or likely exploitation | 14 days |
| Medium | Moderate impact; exploitation less likely | 30 days |
| Low | Minor impact | 90 days |

If an SLA cannot be met, a documented risk acceptance is required (owner + rationale + expiry).

## 5. Workflow (Required Steps)
1) **Detect / Intake**: Vulnerability identified (Dependabot alert, advisory, internal report).  
2) **Triage**: Confirm affected component/version; assign severity; decide fix approach.  
3) **Assign**: Create a tracking record (issue/ticket) and assign an owner + due date based on SLA.  
4) **Remediate**: Implement fix via PR workflow (protected branch + review).  
5) **Verify**: Confirm alert/issue is resolved (tool status, tests, or re-scan).  
6) **Close**: Record closure date, evidence, and lessons learned if needed.

## 6. Tracking Record
All vulnerabilities are tracked in the Vulnerability Log (VULN-LOG-001) with:
- ID, source, component, severity, SLA due date, owner, status, and closure evidence.

## 7. Reporting and Review
- Monthly review of open vulnerabilities and SLA compliance.
- Review outcomes fed into Management Review and risk updates when applicable.
